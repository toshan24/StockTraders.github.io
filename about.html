        <h1>a word about us</h1>
        <p>The internet’s arrival and its subsequent popularity in India have made online trading in India, which is about the online purchase and sales of shares, one of the extremely popular means of trading. Both beginner and experienced traders and investors in India are milking this opportunity by trading online in futures and options, stocks and currencies worldwide. Such opportunities are in the form of reduced brokerage and commissions, better broking services etc. Constructive uses of new technologies have always contributed positively towards improving human life standards and the economy of a country. </p>
        <p>Such as online trading, in equity markets it increased trade volumes and number of investors trading in stock markets. Online trading was started in India in the year 1995, where a new system is formed which allows the investor to trade through an internet site where the major financial products and services like equities, mutual funds, life insurance, general insurance, loans, share trading, commodities trading, portfolio management and financial planning etc. are directly available for the customer. Stock options enable the protection of dealers and control of their stocks, in addition to generation of higher earnings.
